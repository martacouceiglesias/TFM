From this code we are trying to compare the outcomes of several machine learning algorithms from data obtained from an eye-tracker machine.

The data is from two populations, one without any neurological disease and the other with different level of neurodegeneration.

The point is to reach an accuracy of >90% in order to be able to help the diagnosis of neurodegeneratives diseases with the lecture of a couple of texts.
